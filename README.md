# FoulActivity
The **FoulActivity Tracker** is an intelligent monitoring system built using Streamlit, Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, designed to enhance the integrity of mock interviews by tracking the movements and behavior of the interviewee in real-time.
By utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, it detects suspicious activities such as the interviewee looking away from the screen, using external devices, or exhibiting unnatural head and hand movements.
Upon detecting any foul activity, the system instantly issues a warning.
If the interviewee accumulates three warnings, the session is automatically terminated to maintain a fair and controlled interview environment.
The integration of these technologies ensures a seamless and accurate evaluation while discouraging foul practices, making the mock interview process both reliable and secure.
